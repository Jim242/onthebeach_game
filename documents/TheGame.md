# The Game

The original plan was to find and make the Job solution into a fun mini game experience. This would be made with JavaScript and React.

## 
By moving through the stated challenge sequences as tutorial sessions. I thought either a Simon says game, or a memory game pattern sequence would be a challenging task for myself to work with. After looking at how these games played out, I decided to go with card memory game.

```
The app is made with the base of Create-React-App

Using JSX file types â€“ allowing to add XML syntax into JavaScript
```

I have built the first mock-up of the game for you to play. However due to time constraints I was not able to fully implement this. But I thought it would be a shame not to add it in anyway. Hope you enjoy it.
